    \begin{itemize}
        \item Comments on the results obtained
        \item Strong points and weaknesses
        \item Autocriticism about weaknesses that affect the final result
        \item Future Work
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Data efficiency and Model-based approaches through a better study of bibliography
                  \item Usage of Variational Auto Encoder (VAE): this is a possible additional step towards the creation of the model (VAE used for data generation as a generative model). It must not overwrite the first future work.
                  \item New Version of Cozmo (Vector) with a better camera and LIDAR (Data fusion);
              \end{itemize}

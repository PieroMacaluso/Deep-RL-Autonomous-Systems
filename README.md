# A Study Of Reinforcement Learning
Stuff about my Master Thesis
## Path of my Master Thesis
- Studying the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning throught watching **[v1](#video-lectures)** and reading some chapters from **[b1](#books)**.
- Studying **[p1](#papers)** and **[p2](#papers)** in order to produce an initial working code of DDPG algorithm on a continuous and well-known environment on the OpenAI Gym environment.
  - **Main aim:** try to implement the algorithm as generic as possible in order to mantain flexibility
  - **Possible developments**: Find out if it could be better to develop the code with **[D4PG (Deep Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients) ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08617.pdf)** or **[SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01290.pdf)**
- Generalizing the code to work with CNN and images in an environment as similar as possible to the target one ([Anki Cozmo](https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo))
